                <div>Currently living in Boise, Idaho I am experienced digital designer and iOS developer producing digital content, creating
    websites using React, HTML, CSS and wordpress, as well as designing and developing iOS applications for the App Store in
    native swift. Transitioning from designer to developer has given me a unique insight at the intersection of design and
    development, being a fan of Apple I believe that both must work together correctly to make a truly special product.</div>
